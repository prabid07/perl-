# Learning Perl <br>
<b>Author- Prabin Chandra Gautam</b><br>
I have learned the basics of Perl, including variables, loops, conditionals, and string manipulation. I've also explored file handling, regular expressions, and simple scripting. Moving forward, I plan to dive deeper into advanced topics like modules, object-oriented Perl, complex regex patterns, and Perl's use in system administration, web scraping, and data processing.
